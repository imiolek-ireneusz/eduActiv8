.SH "USAGE"

The game will start by default in windowed mode, but it can be changed into a fullscreen mode. The configuration will be maintained whenever it is started again later.

Initially a login screen will be presented to the user. Users can either create an offline account for themselves or use the default Guest account. When logging into the game a desired age (school year) can be selected to fine tune the difficulty of activities.

When logged in, the game will present a starting screen with 3 main groups of categories of activities to choose from. When a group is selected a list of all categories suitable for previously selected age group will be shown. Further selection of a category will display a list of available activities. Upon clicking on an activity icon it will start taking up the whole screen. A back button is located in the top left corner to go back to the previous screen.

There are two steps to selecting a language. The language selected on the login screen will change the language of the login screen only, but also will be used as a default language for new users. After logging in individual users can choose a different language - the icon to access the language selection screen is located in the bottom left corner of the home screen - the language selected here will be saved for each user individually. This allows users to use the program to learn other languages.
