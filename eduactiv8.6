.SH "USAGE"
The application starts by default in windowed mode but can be switched to fullscreen by pressing Ctrl+F after logging in, or via the Preferences on the login screen. Fullscreen preference is saved for future sessions.

Upon launch, a login screen is presented. Users can create an offline account or use the default Guest account. A desired age (school year) can be selected during login to fine-tune activity difficulty.

Once logged in, the home screen displays three main categories of activities. Selecting a group presents a list of categories suitable for the chosen age, and further selection reveals available activities. Clicking an activity icon starts it in full-screen mode. A 'back' button in the top-left corner allows navigation to previous screens.

Language selection is twofold: a language chosen on the login screen sets the default for new users and the login screen itself. After logging in, individual users can select a different language via an icon in the bottom-left corner of the home screen; this preference is saved per user, allowing the program to be used for learning other languages.

.SH "FILES"
User-specific game data for eduActiv8 is stored in the `~/.local/share/eduactiv8/` directory.
